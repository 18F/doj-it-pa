# DOJ IT Path Analysis

## Welcome!

This repo contains documentation and about the DOJ IT Path Analysis engagement.
It is intended to be a place where project team members, stakeholders, and
other interested parties can keep track of goals and resources as we work
together.

## Engagement

The OCIO within DOJ wants to complete an analysis of the IT Functions within
three components of the DOJ and the Justice Management Division (JMD). DOJ
believes there may be opportunities to streamline and consolidate certain
common IT Functions within the separate DOJ components to better meet the
needs of users, reduce administrative burden and duplication and increase
cost savings.

The three components DOJ has identified for assessment are:
 - The Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD)
 - The Civil Rights Division (CRT)
 - The DOJ Tax Division (TAX)

An assessment will also need to be completed on the JMD, which currently
provides shared IT services and support to 4,500 end users across 18 locations.

## Planned Deliverables

18F will:
 - Complete user and stakeholder research.
 - Take an inventory of the main IT Function systems, resources,
   and assets involved.
 - Assess the main IT functions within the three components and JMD to
   identify potential opportunities, if any, for migration.

Since the components currently have varying IT capabilities, end users and
mission needs, 18F will tailor its analysis to each component.
Recommendations could range from not consolidating any IT Functions to
holistically rebuilding the IT Functions of all three components and JMD
into one. 18F will also work to identify potential adverse impacts of
migration opportunities to DOJ component operations and missions.
